# Constructorconconstruct!
This project is a spin-off from the classic word guess game created earlier, however we will be using the command line via node to to play the game this time around

## Technology and packages used

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [figlet](https://github.com/henriknorberg/node-figlet)
* [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)
* [is-letter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-letter)

## How to play
Upon starting you will be asked to enter your name and asked if you would like to play:
![picture that shows starting the game]()

you will then have ten chances to guess the correct letters of the word if you should win:
![picture that shows winning screen]()

if you should lose:
![pictue of losing screen](https://github.com/welljer/constructorconconstruct/blob/master/images/loss.JPG)

in both cases you will be asked if you would like to play again as well as have the win/lose counter increment.
